                <p>"Sandes is an open source-based, secure, cloud-enabled platform. It is hosted by the government and
                    on government infrastructure ensuring the control remains with the government only. With features
                    like one-to-one and group messaging, file and media sharing, audio-video call and e-gov application
                    integration, etc. It is available at Google Play Store and the App Store," Rajeev Chandrasekhar said
                    in response to a query, reported CNBC TV18.

                    The government pursued the 'Sandes' app development, along with other projects involving homemade
                    apps and software, aggressively, after its spat with WhatsApp over end-to-end encryption and the new
                    IT rules, the news platform reported.

                    As per the app description on Google Play Store, Sandes is hosted exclusively at government
                    infrastructure. It supports end-to-end encrypted messaging and encrypted backup and encrypted OTP
                    service. Its privacy and data policy is governed by the rules and regulations of the government of
                    India. Currently, Sandes has been integrated with NIC email, DigiLocker and e-office. Also, full
                    features of Sandes app are available only to the government-verified users, says the app
